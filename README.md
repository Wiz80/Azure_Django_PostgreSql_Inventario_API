# Inventory API with Django, PostgreSQL and Azure 

This API was developed using the tutorial given in `Microsoft Learn` <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-python-postgresql-app?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-portal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cazure-portal-access%2Cvscode-aztools-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cdeploy-instructions--zip-azcli%2Cdeploy-instructions-curl-bash">Here</a>

Instead of making 
```git
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/djangoapp
```
You can use
```git
git clone https://github.com/Wiz80/Azure_Django_PostgreSql_Inventario_API.git
```

It is requested to develop a system in which the user by means of a flat file (.csv) uploads an inventory template to a üê≤`PostgreSQL DB`. It should be noted that the file must first be uploaded to a :herb: `BlobStorage of Azure` and after its upload the data must be created or updated in the model of the DB in the corresponding case in order to have a loading and processing log of the same.

## Instructions :rocket:

### 1. Follow the `first step` of the Microsoft tutorial instructions   

:exclamation: Don't forget to change the `.env` file to connect your postgreSQL local database :exclamation:

When running:

You can download this inventory <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19aRZj6k9Zk2dsgCURbaGY3ykRd8d9iHECSp7oCGlvgQ/edit?usp=sharing">Test document</a>

##### Please, don't upload your .csv file until you change your `config.yaml` file in your `inventario_app` directory, you could change this file following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enhJfb_6KYU&t=354s"> this tutorial </a>  

### 2. When you have already change the config.yaml file and run the server again and upload the .csv file, you could go to your Containers in Azure Storage
